# Simulated Chromestesia

Chromestesia, or Sound-to-Color Synesthesia, is a condition where a person is able to see colors that match the noises they hear. For example, if a guitar string is plucked, a person with Chromestesia will also sense a specific color matching the note that was played.

This project uses an electronic keyboard, a Raspberry Pi, and LED strips to simulate this experience.
